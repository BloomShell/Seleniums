#### Yahoo-Finance symbols scraper
In any quant project it is useful to have a complete repository of symbols available all over the world. The Yahoo-Finance catalog is complete and the API could be used to decode all the symbols in order to download useful information starting from the list of tickers. This solution uses the Yahoo-Finance screener to get a complete list of tuples (Symbol, Name) for each exchange (Nyse, Nasdaq, Bse).  ***To*** use the solution you just call the ***symbols.py*** with no arguments. Default saving extension is pickle.
